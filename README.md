## About The website
This is  a website application that has quotes and prompts the user to add new quotes.

## BDD

The user will see some of the quotes added previously and has an option of adding a new quote to the existing ones.
The user will input the quote itself, author, title and the date they added the quote.

Then click addQuote button which will add the entries to the other quotes.

The user can also like another quote and dislike it if thet please and also delete the quote.

## Known Bugs
